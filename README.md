## 📌 Project Scope

DevConnect is designed to address the unique formatting and social requirements of the software engineering community. It bridges the gap between raw markdown writing and responsive community engagement. The scope includes:
1. **Secure Access Management:** Complete JWT-based registration/login flows and modern Google OAuth login integration.
2. **Interactive Content Authoring:** A rich-text editor (Quill-based) that handles sanitization, media embedding, custom tags, auto-read-time estimation, and drafts vs. publishing states.
3. **Community & Engagement:** Deep nesting of comments, likes, and dashboard-integrated bookmarking.
4. **Platform Administration:** Admin dashboards displaying aggregated metrics (views, users, blogs) and offering moderation features (deleting posts, removing users).
5. **Global Delivery & Performance:** CDN-driven image uploading via Cloudinary and edge deployments on Render and Vercel.
